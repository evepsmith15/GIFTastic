# GIFTastic

This code takes one of the original key API and adds onto it. Instead of having just 3 buttons (which are there for placeholders), the whitespace allows you to type an animal thus creating a button. That button will then search for 10 GIFS of said animal. 

Update: The code allows you to type in any animal and it will search for said animal. However, it requires a double click for the submit button to be read.
